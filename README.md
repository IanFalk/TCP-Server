# TCP-Server
A project that creates a client/server that communicates using the TCP protocol. 
The client can send a simple equation (+-/*) to the server, and the server responds with the result of the equation.

ManualTCPClient allows you to connect with a client that you can manually send equations to the server with.
AutoTCPClient automatically and randomly sends equations to the server.
